EMHD.nb contains calculations for the determinant of the principal part of EMHD plus added bulk (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09970).

The code works by rotating to the local rest frame of the average fluid velocity $g^{\mu\nu}\rightarrow \textrm{diag}(-1,+1,+1,+1)$, $u^\mu \rightarrow (1,0,0,0)$, $b^\mu \rightarrow (0,0,0,b)$, but makes no assumption on the dynamics/geometry of the system.
